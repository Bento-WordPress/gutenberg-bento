/**
 The contain CSS property allows an author to indicate that an element

.gutenberg-bento-carousel-wrapper > .block-editor-block-list__layout > [class^="carousel-"] {
	contain: content !important;
}
/* stylelint-enable selector-class-pattern */

/*
 Now the carousel is unconstrained in terms of height. Let's use
 overflow: hidden to work around the lack of `contain: content` above.

	overflow: hidden;

.gutenberg-bento-carousel .wp-block-image {

}
